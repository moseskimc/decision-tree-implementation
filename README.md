# decision-tree-implementation

In this repo, we implement a decision tree model from scratch.


## Data

Normally, data should be stored in the repo but, in our case, we make an exception since our data is only 8kb. If you wish to see an overview of the data visit the kaggle link [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yersever/500-person-gender-height-weight-bodymassindex?resource=download)

- numpy


## Script

To run predictions, run the following command:

    PYTHONPATH=./ python src/main.py



## Notebook

For more detailed exposition and step-by-step overview of how decision trees are built, the reader is advised to look at the notebook in addition to using the script.
